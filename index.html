                  Long time the manxome foe he sought— <br>
            So rested he by the Tumtum tree <br>
                  And stood awhile in thought.</p> <br></article>

            <article><p>And, as in uffish thought he stood, <br>
                  The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, <br>
            Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, <br>
                  And burbled as it came!</p> <br> </article>

            He left it dead, and with its head <br>
                  He went galumphing back. </p><br></article>
